## Description
Internet surveillance system: Estimation of measles cases from Google Trends.
## Extended description
In recent years, new forms of syndromic surveillance that use data from the Internet have been proposed. These have been developed to assist the early prediction of epidemics in various cases and diseases. It has been found that these systems are accurate in monitoring and predicting outbreaks before these are observed in the population, and, therefore, they can be used as a complement to other methods. 
This code aims to examine a highly infectious disease, measles, using Google Trends data.
